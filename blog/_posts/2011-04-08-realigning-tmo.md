A good friend of mine, named Simon, is webmaster at [tanzmusik-online.de](http://www.tanzmusik-online.de/). If you wanna dance to your favorite song, but don't know what, this is the place to go to. It is almost impossible to not find your song because the data base behind the website is huge and every new submission is personally validated by Simon. A lot of work but it's worth it. The songs range from Abba to ZZ Top, from Pop to Heavy Metal and from '70 until today.

But there is one thing that's bothering me. The design doesn't fit the great service. 2006 was the last time the website got a new skin. But in it looks more like a millennium design. In this post I'll present some ideas, which hopefully help to improve the usability and appearance for the next design.

### The front page ###

When you land on the front page you'll see a lot of stuff. You cannot focus on one thing. There is an ad for the community, a small banner, whose only purpose is to be there, some news, the newest submissions and so on, and so on. The problem is not that there is too much stuff on the front page. The alignment is just not quite right and a new visitor has no clue what the purpose of the website is. The latter bothers me the most. Instead of the banner and the community ad, tell the visitor what he/she can do here! There is enough space below for the rest.

The possibility to search is obviously the most important part, but on the front page (and every other page) there is only this little search field at the upper right. TMO (TanzMusik-Online) is more or less a search engine, thus the search field should be easily visible at all time. At least on the front page I would suggest a big search form.

The rest of the information presented on the front page can be summarized. The news, which inform about site updates, don't need to be on the front page. It would be better to have a small blog for that. Rather put the last submission, charts and a tag cloud on the front page. These three are the most important information for new and returning visitors. The top submitter and top dances are nice to know at most.

This leaves us with a layout like this:

I also created some drafts, which outline a possible "update" for the design. The graphics shouldn't be fancy or awesome. They are awesome if they support the usability.

Since I moved the navigation to the top and made it horizontal there is not enough space for every sub items anymore. Some of them are redundant and can be removed (e.g. home, search). The dance sub menu ("Latein", "Standard", "Modet√§nze") on the other hand is very important for browsing the site. I propose another solution for the navigation dilemma. Everything not listed in the navigation will be moved to the footer.

### Search Results ###

Another important part is the listings of songs. The listing is used everywhere (e.g. display charts, search results or dance categories). This is how the look right now:

And this is my proposal:

Yeah, I made it bigger. But this doesn't necessary means that it's better. But in this case the additional space provides more readability. I think the old listing displayed too much information. The details should be displayed later.

### Social Networks ###

The current design is old and because of this there is no integration of social networks. I am not sure if Simon wants to implement social networking or if he will solely rely on his own message board. I certainly would add some Twitter and Facebook buttons to (hopefully) improve the conversion rate even further.

At least a TMO Facebook page should be considered. Nobody has a guestbook anymore. It is so convenient to use Facebook instead. This also may help boost the forum, because you can sign up with your Facebook account.

### Conclusion ###

The designs presented are all drafts. They should be considered anchor points for further development. I promised Simon that as soon as I finished my blog I would help him redesigning TMO. This posting illustrates my first thoughts on what (in my opinion) has to improve.
